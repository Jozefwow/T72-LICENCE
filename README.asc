Let's go and sing to
Hashem and shout out
cheers to the One who
always saves us.
Let's approach Him with
songs of gratitude.


Because He is so good
and powerful. He's the
greatest King!

David frequently said,
"Protect me Hashem,
because You're my only
place to hide."

"HaShem,  You really
don't need to do this good
just for me."

I didn't earn this.  I get
everything I need because
of  my holy and deceased
ancestors  who  were
enormous in their fear of
God.
